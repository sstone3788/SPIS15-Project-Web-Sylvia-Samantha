Don't stop believin'
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume


My Girl
Well I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

Ice Ice Baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen 

Smells like teen spirit
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us

I believe I can fly
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh

Living on a prayer
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man

Don't Stop me Now
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive and the world it's turning inside out Yeah!

My heart will go on
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Bohemian Rhapsody
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die


Ain't no mountain high enough
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me darling
